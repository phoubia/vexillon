<summary>What exactly are FastFlags</summary>
<hr>
<img src="https://github.com/phoubia/vexillon/blob/main/pics/vexillonlowquality.png" align="right" width="385">
FastFlags are a powerful tool created by Roblox engineers to control how the Roblox client works. They allow certain features of the game engine to be adjusted without needing a full update. This makes Roblox flexible and efficient, but using FastFlags incorrectly can lead to problems with the game’s performance and stability. FastFlags let Roblox engineers change how certain parts of the client function. For example, they can enable or disable features, change values, or skip certain processes in the game engine. Players can also override these flags manually to adjust how Roblox works on their own device. Using FastFlags without knowing what they do can break the client or cause bugs. Importing large lists of flags is especially risky because it can affect many parts of the game at once. It’s important to only change flags if you fully understand what they do.
FastFlags are often used to improve performance, especially for players with low-end computers. For example, you can disable textures, reduce render distance, or improve network response time. These adjustments can make Roblox run smoother on slower systems. The picture on the right demonstrates these FastFlags. FastFlags are commonly found in <a href="https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/blob/roblox/FVariables.txt">Fvariables.txt</a> from a useful repository made by MaximumADHD. FastFlags are a great tool, but they come with responsibility. FastFlags altering physics might get you banned in your favorite games. If you choose to use them, make sure you understand how they work and avoid making big changes all at once. We are not responsible for bans or whatever so don't make a ticket blaming us.

<summary>Will Roblox ban me for using Vexillon?</summary>
<hr>
Practically, no. Roblox can't just ban people for using FastFlags as they're in quite a hard situation at the moment to knowing for what reason people are using fastflags. Just banning anyone using FastFlags would be pretty harsh and unfair because everyone has their own reasons. Games inside of roblox can detect when your character preforms suspicoius activities like having very high jumps or whatever.

The least you could do to help us with this project is to donate or design a ui stylesheet. To do this head over to the source folder and find the stylesheet.qss file. Qss is similar to Css but it's made for a python ui library. Under the readme.md in the folder you'll find additional information about the stylesheet
