FastFlags are tools created by Roblox engineers to control how the client works, enabling adjustments without full updates. They allow features to be enabled, values changed, or processes skipped, but improper use can cause performance issues or bugs. 

Players can override FastFlags to improve performance, such as reducing textures or render distance for smoother gameplay on low-end systems. The screenshot provided on the right side demonstrates someone using a popular low quality FastFlags preset. However, importing large lists or altering physics can lead to bans or crashes. Use them responsibly and fully understand their function before making changes.

All FastFlags are listen on <a href="https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/blob/roblox/FVariables.txt">this</a> file in a repository made by MaximumADHD. Vexillon is not responsible for bans caused by Roblox games that have an anti-cheat. Roblox games without an anti cheat won't get you banned for using FastFlags.

<summary>Will Roblox ban me for using Vexillon?</summary>
<hr>
Practically, no. Roblox can't just ban people for using FastFlags as they're in quite a hard situation at the moment to knowing for what reason people are using fastflags. Just banning anyone using FastFlags would be pretty harsh and unfair because everyone has their own reasons. Games inside of roblox can detect when your character preforms suspicoius activities like having very high jumps or whatever.

The least you could do to help us with this project is to donate or design a ui stylesheet. To do this head over to the source folder and find the stylesheet.qss file. Qss is similar to Css but it's made for a python ui library. Under the readme.md in the folder you'll find additional information about the stylesheet.

We made a lot of commits earlier due to a mistake. Instead of previewing changes, we clicked commit directly to see the effect on even the smallest adjustments. This caused issues with tracking the progress of the repository. To make important changes more noticeable, we will ensure that the commit names are more recognizable.
